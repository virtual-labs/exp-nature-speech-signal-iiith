### Procedure

- Step1: Load speech for three vowels in the context of heed (for vowel /i/), head (for vowel /e/) and hod (for vowel /a/).

- Step2: Click on the 'Generate Spectrum' button to view its autocorrelation sequence and LP log spectrum.

- Step3: Click on the 'Play/Pause' button and observe the waveform.

- Step4: Note the average fundamental frequency (F0) using time domain representation.

- Step5: Note the formant frequencies (F1, F2 and F3) from the obtained LP spectrum.

- Step6: Repeat for one more set of vowels.

- Step7: Compare the readings from the two sets (variability within a given speaker).

- Step8: Compare the average fundamental frequency (F0) and formant frequency values of one speaker with values from other speakers (variability among speakers).

- Step9: Write a brief note on the observations.
